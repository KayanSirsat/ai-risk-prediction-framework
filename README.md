# AI-Driven Risk Prediction and Mitigation Framework

This repository contains the design and ongoing implementation of an AI-driven
risk prediction and mitigation framework developed as part of my Final Year
Project (B.E. Computer Engineering).

The objective of this project is to design a unified, explainable AI system
that predicts project risks, forecasts deviations, detects anomalies, and
provides actionable mitigation insights using Machine Learning (ML),
Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Explainable AI (XAI).

## Project Status
This project is currently in a Stage-1 → Stage-2 transition phase.

### Completed
- System architecture and module design
- Software Requirement Specification (IEEE-style)
- Literature survey and research gap analysis

### In Progress
- Risk classification model implementation
- SHAP-based explainability integration
- Time-series forecasting (Prophet)
- NLP-based qualitative risk detection

### Planned
- Streamlit dashboard integration
- Jira API live data ingestion
- Full evaluation and deployment

## Tech Stack
Python, scikit-learn, XGBoost, Prophet, SHAP, spaCy, Streamlit, FastAPI

## Documentation
Design documents and reports are available in the `docs/` directory.
