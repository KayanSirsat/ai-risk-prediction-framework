# AI-Driven Risk Prediction and Mitigation Framework

This repository contains the design and ongoing implementation of an AI-driven
risk prediction and mitigation framework developed as part of my Final Year
Project (B.E. Computer Engineering).

Current status:
- System architecture and SRS completed
- ML, NLP, forecasting, and XAI modules under active development

This repository reflects a Stage-1 to Stage-2 transition of the project.
